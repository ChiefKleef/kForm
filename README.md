Redux-controlled form interface built in React. Enter name and a build a list of hobbies + mock-async submit. Tests in format '.spec.jsx' using Mocha and Enzyme.

**Coding challenge was presented to me like this:**
"Using  React/Redux:
 
-Write a form that takes user input for first name, last name & list of hobbies (it can be more than one).
-The form should have a submit button.
-Upon submit, display ‘Loading …’ below the form, after a few seconds delay (mock async call) change the text to ‘Done!’.
-In a textarea below the form show only the first name & last name the user submitted.
-No need to write any server side code. On submit just wait with a setTimeout().
-Maintain all the states in a redux store
-Include appropriate test coverage."

**Commands:**
  - `npm run dev`
  - `npm test`
